                    <p>I am Lee Simpson, a strategist and entrepreneur with over two decades of experience in engineering, design, marketing, and strategy. Based in Los Angeles, California, I have played a pivotal role in launching digitally enabled products and services for some of the world's largest brands.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am the founder and principal at smpsn, an independent client-service practice specializing in product strategy and experience innovation.</p>
                    <p>Previously, I worked with the award-winning agency ustwo as the Head of TV and Entertainment. During my tenure, I led projects for major media companies such as Netflix, Warner Bros., and YouTube, creating innovative products and experiences to tackle complex business challenges in the interactive entertainment and content sectors.</p>
                    <p>Before ustwo, I served as a Product Lead at The Guardian News and Media, driving the strategic design and implementation of their next-generation publishing tools.</p>
                    <p>I frequently speak at industry events, including the New York Media Festival and the Northside Innovation Festival, and my insights have been featured in CIO Review, AdWeek, and Communication Arts. I have also shared my knowledge as a guest lecturer at institutions like Hyper Island, Newcastle College, and General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>I have mentored at accelerator programs such as Ignite and the Capitol Records 360 Innovation Program, advising startups and guiding leadership teams toward success. Additionally, I have delivered talks at conferences, including the Dallas Society of Visual Communications, Percolate DesignTalks NY, Pure London, and Untangle The Web.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I have worked with a diverse array of brands and organizations, including Google, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Samsung, and Warner Bros.</p>
                    <p>I am inspired by the ever-evolving landscape of media, entertainment, and the creator economy. The rapid advancements in technology and emerging platforms offer exciting avenues for innovation. My passion lies in helping creators and businesses connect with their audiences in meaningful ways, driving growth and success in this dynamic digital world.</p>
