                <p>Hello, I'm Lee Simpson, a product strategist and innovation leader with over two decades of experience guiding businesses from concept to launch.</p>
                <p>My career has been defined by a deep curiosity for how design, technology, and strategy intersect to solve complex problems, create value, and drive growth.</p>
                <p>Originally from the UK and now based in Los Angeles, I've dedicated my career to creating and launching transformative products and services for some of the world's most iconic brands. My work is fueled by a passion for innovation, a sharp understanding of consumer behavior, and a drive to turn bold ideas into impactful outcomes.</p>
                <p>After high school, I founded Rebelo, a fashion brand and art collective that provided a platform for independent artists and designers. By blending creativity and commerce, Rebelo launched successful collections and curated exhibitions that connected global audiences with emerging talent.</p>
                <p>In 2006, I established a boutique design and development studio specializing in digital solutions for commercial art galleries. Over time, the studio expanded to work with high-profile clients such as Virgin Casinos, the NHS, BBC, and Reckitt Benckiser. I also collaborated with Ostmodern, helping to create innovative OTT platforms and content management systems for broadcasters like ITV and Channel 4.</p>
                <p>In 2012, I joined The Guardian News & Media, where I led the development of Composer, a proprietary tool that redefined how journalists create digital-first stories. I also played a key role in launching <a href="https://www.theguardian.com" target="_blank">theguardian.com</a>'s flexible design framework, which expanded its global reach and supported its transition to digital-first publishing.</p>
                <p>In 2014, I moved to New York to join <a href="https://www.ustwo.com" target="_blank">ustwo</a>, an award-winning product studio. There, I led strategic initiatives for clients, including YouTube, Netflix, Warner Bros, and Comcast, positioning the company as a global leader in fan engagement and audience experiences.</p>
                <p>In 2020, I founded <a href="https://www.smpsn-co.com" target="_blank">smpsn</a>, a strategy consultancy that partners with brands like Fox Entertainment, Samsung, and Google to launch groundbreaking products and services. Our work blends design, technology, and strategy to develop solutions that drive lasting impact for brands in media, retail, and healthcare.</p>
                <p>In 2024, I founded <a href="https://www.creatorplayground.io" target="_blank">Creator Playground</a>, which is focused on empowering independent creators and artists with tools that enable operational autonomy, sustainable growth, and creative freedom. We're building a new generation of enterprise and marketplace platforms designed to address the unique challenges of the creator economy.</p>
                <p>Throughout my career, I've been guided by the belief that meaningful innovation starts with understanding human needs and cultural shifts. A lifelong passion for music, television, art, and gaming inspires me to create products that resonate deeply with audiences, customers, and fans.</p>
