# About

My name is Lee Simpson I am a product strategist and designer at [ustwo](http://www.ustwo.com), New York.

I've spent the last 13 years building awesome products with smart people. I've have the pleasure of working with Comcast, American Express, The Guardian and Google on projects that span finance, educational VR, broadcasting and publishing. I am a startup advisor, lecturer and conference speaker â€” oh, and sometimes I write.
