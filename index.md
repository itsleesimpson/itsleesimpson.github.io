_Hello._ My name is Lee Simpson.

I'm a lead product designer and strategist at [ustwo](http://www.ustwo.com), New York.

For the past 13 years I’ve worked with teams to bring awesome digital products and services to market. Some of the projects I've worked on include finance, educational VR, video content and publishing for companies like Comcast, American Express, The Guardian and BBC. I'm also an early stage startup advisor on [Ignite100](http://ignite100.com).

I specialize in user centered design, rapid concept validation and product thinking.
