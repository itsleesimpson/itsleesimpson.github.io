My name is Lee Simpson I am a product strategist and designer at [ustwo](http://www.ustwo.com), New York.

I've spent the last 13 years of my life building awesome products, with smart people. I've had the pleasure of working with the likes of Comcast, American Express, The Guardian and Google on projects that cover finance, educational VR, broadcasting and publishing. I am a startup advisor, lecturer and conference speaker — oh, and sometimes I write.
