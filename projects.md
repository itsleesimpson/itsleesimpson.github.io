## The Future of TV, ustwo, 2016

Over the course of 3 months I lead a small team looking at interaction design for the 10ft experience and ‘The Future of TV’. Through rapid prototyping and testing we experimented with and validated various concepts around content discovery and TV commerce.

## The Guardian, Network Fronts, 2014

At The Guardian I worked with the editorial team and the core product team to establish and execute a content framework for the website’s network fronts. Based on the concept of ‘containers’ the framework provided a flexible model for serving different page layouts and content types depending on the news of the day.
